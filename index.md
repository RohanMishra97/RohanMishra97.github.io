I am an incoming MS CS student at University of California San Diego.
I completed by bachelors in Softwarer Engineering from Delhi Technological University in 2019. I did research as an undergraduate under [Prof. Rajiv Ratn Shah](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/rajivratn) on using Social Graphs to understand Suicide Ideation and analysing Political Debates.

I worked as a Graduate Analyst at Citi India on problems related to Anomaly Detection, Trade Settlement Analysis and Automated Incident Management. Subsequntly, I joined [Taktile](https://www.taktile.com/) as a Software Engineer to build a SaaS platform for ML driven decisioning.
